This mod adds a fourth upgrade path to the Dartling Gunner.

Below you'll find a list of upgrades, as well as some notes about balance and design. This is a mod so don't expect perfect balance, but I am a game design nerd so I try to put a lot of thought into my design choices.

<h2>Uprade Info:</h2>

<h3>Tier 1: Bouncy Darts</h3>

$210

<h4>Description:</h4>

Allows projectiles to bounce off of solid obstacles.

<h4>Detailed notes:</h4>

I've always thought it was a shame that only Juggernaut (and engi's juggernaut sentries) get to have this incredibly unique mechanic of bouncing off of obstacles, so I thought I'd give that power to the dartling gunner, which can take even greater advantage of good bounce angles because of the fine user control that dartling allows. Not much to say about this upgrade, it naturally synergizes with other paths on any map where LOS is an issue. (Although it has no effect on plasma accelerator, I figured the tier 2 crosspath is more than enough to make up for that.)

<h3>Tier 2: Hi-Impact Darts</h3>

$1200

<h4>Description:</h4>

Bloons are knocked back a small amount when hit. (Buckshot gets increased knockback.)

<h4>Detailed notes:</h4>

Giving any dartling path the option of having knockback is incredibly powerful and as such, the knockback from this upgrade is slightly nerfed compared to Dark Knight or Buckshot. Still, it's a fair tradeoff for the dps you lose out on by choosing this crosspath over the others; I'm especially fond of how it interacts with plasma accelerator, shifting its role from being more damage focused to becoming an impenetrable wall for supercerams. In any case, it seemed like a natural lead-in to the primary theme of this upgrade path.

<h3>Tier 3: Gumball Turret</h3>

$4800

<h4>Description:</h4>

Shoots giant balls of goo at the bloons which hit more bloons, have increased lifespan, and can knock back small blimps.

<h4>Detailed notes:</h4>

- This upgrade changes the damage type to shatter, similarly to buckshot, which allows frozen-popping.
- This upgrade adds a pushback effect to MOABs and DDTs, and a weaker one to BFBs.
- This upgrade makes the dartling shoot slightly slower, which was needed to balance out the benefit of the MOAB knockback. In addition, the attack speed increase from middle crosspath is reduced for this path because it just synergized too well with the stalling power.
- MOABs eat up 4 pierce per hit for the gumballs. Each gumball has 8 pierce, or 12 with powerful darts.
- Gumballs get +1 bonus damage vs MOABs. This is mostly to reduce this tower's capacity for stalling rounds forever.
- Gumballs get doubled projectile lifespan, allowing them to bounce around much more. With powerful darts, projectile lifespan is tripled instead.

Gumball Turret has just enough pierce to be relevant as a damage-dealer, but will struggle against even a few ceramics. The main purpose of this path is to stall MOABs, and on its own, Gumball Turret is decent at this. It's a bit more expensive than MOAB shove, a tower which also has map-wide coverage, a crosspath with camo detection, and a much more powerful stall, but it beats out MOAB shove in a couple ways: first of all it's much quicker to maneuver, and second of all, its stalling power scales with its attack rate and pierce. Stick this guy under a jungle drums village and alch buff and watch its effectiveness sky-rocket, and on maps with lots of obstacles, the bouncing can also work in your favor to create a truly powerful stall. Dare I even mention the possibility of buying *multiple* turrets to work together... I also intentionally made the knockback much more effective against DDTs than other options to give this guy a proper niche, but you'll need to give it camo detection and lead popping before it will work.

<h3>Tier 4: Heavy Metal Alloy</h3>

$14000

<h4>Description:</h4>

A powerful non-newtonian substance engineered in monkey laboratories to deliver the maximum punch. Damages all bloon types, knocks back bigger blimps and also stuns smaller ones.

<h4>Detailed notes:</h4>

- This upgrade adds a stun effect to MOABs and DDTs, increases the power of pushback towards BFBs and adds a weak pushback towards ZOMGs
- This upgrade changes the damage type to normal, which allows lead-popping.
- This upgrade triples the pierce of gumballs (8 -> 24, or 12 -> 36 with powerful darts)
- This upgrade adds +1 bonus damage to MOABs, as well as +1 damage to laser shock.

With this upgrade, stalling MOABs and DDTs infinitely becomes trivial, which makes it an ideal option to get as a late-game patch job for defenses that can't deal with DDTs easily, similar to Spike Storm. It's considerably more expensive than Spike Storm though, and that's for good reason. This is by far the best MOAB staller in the game that isn't a tier 5, paragon or temple, making it a worthy addition to almost any defense. A pair of them is powerful enough to rival the stalling powers of Super Glue, and with map-wide range, although it would be more cost-efficient to just overclock a single one. Its only weaknesses are a lack of substantial dps and low pierce, meaning that you still need to have decent firepower to prevent bloons from clumping up and overwhelming the tower.

<h3>Tier 5: Siege Engine Prototype</h3>

$54000

<h4>Description:</h4>

What happens when a wave of bloons meets an unstoppable force? Shoots gigantic wrecking balls which move slower but plow through bloons like they're not even there, knocking them back continuously as they roll and shattering reinforcements.

<h4>Detailed notes:</h4>

- This upgrade extends the stun effect to last longer and also affect BFBs, and it increases the pushback effect towards ZOMGs.
- Wrecking balls deal 10 damage to all bloon types (no more bonus MOAB damage) and have 360 pierce (540 with powerful darts).
- Wrecking balls strip fortified from all bloons up to a ZOMG, similar to Shattering Shells.
- Wrecking balls have a rehit mechanic similar to kylie boomerangs which allow them to hit the same bloon several times.
- Wrecking balls move at half speed and have double the lifespan.
- This upgrade reduces attack rate to one fifth of its previous rate.
- Laser shock now deals 10 damage.

With dramatically reduced attack rate, this tower is actually less reliable of a staller than the tier 4, however, its biggest weakness has been removed. With enough pierce to knockback the entirety of the wave all at once on most rounds, this tower is almost a win-condition for CHIMPS on most maps. All it needs as support is something to clean up ceramics, which can still slip past on occasion given their speed compared to the wrecking balls, and something to bring enough dps to deal with the denser late game rounds and the BAD. Even more so than the rest of the path, the tier 5 benefits from maps with lots of LOS blockers, since the wrecking balls are more effective the longer they stay on screen colliding with bloons. Crosspath effects have been adjusted to make sure this tower doesn't fall to the same fate as ultra-juggernaut though of being *only* viable on those types of maps. Typically, top crosspath is best for DPS, middle path is best for stalling/camo, and bottom path is best in general if playing on a map with LOS blockers.
